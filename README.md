## Overview

Welcome to the Mixer Front End repository!

You can check out the deployed version here --> https://mixerdb.netlify.app/

Mixer is a full stack mixology web application where users can browse information about various cocktails and ingredients as well as keep track of their favorite ones.

The cocktail and ingredient information comes from MixerDB, an API which I built for the purposes of this project.
